# Magic
Magic in the elseworld is created by “modifying the source code of reality”. This is done through the words of command. There are not many words of command, but by speaking or writing them in a specific order one can do nearly anything. 
## Words of Command
The most basic building blocks in magic are the words of command. These are derived from the Hebrew language, though not all are words of command. 
A single word of command is useless by itself, but when combined …
For example the word “fire” by itself or the word “create” by itself don’t mean anything, however if you combine them you can `MAKE FIRE`. 
## Energy Souces
This alone is not enough to create an effect. Like everything else magic needs a power source. The most common source is biological energy (nephesh), but there is an authority to magical sources. For example you can’t use someone else’s nephesh in ordinary circumstances, unless they use a spell to give you that authority. 
## Scrolls
### and written words of power
Scrolls are a common form of magic. A Mage will write a spell out on a scroll using Runes of Command (the written form of Words of Command). The scroll may have an activation word which can be used by anyone to activate it. Once activated the scroll is destroyed like flash paper. 
Another use of a scroll is memorization. If a Mage memorizes a scroll he can call forth the power of that spell multiple times simply using the activation word, however should he forget any portion of the spell there may be unpredictable consequences. 
Activation words can really be anything, but typically need to mean something to the caster. Some scrolls are designed to be used only once and are always consumed. Others can only be used be a Mage who can understand them, but can be used indefinitely. Some are designed to be either one determined by the activation word - ensuring that someone doesn’t accidentally destroy it if they forget the spell and try to use it - or by whether the spell has been memorized. The latter is often used with more dangerous spells as a sort of safety net (like a checksum of sorts) destroying the scroll to prevent a spell from backfiring. 
Bequeather scrolls are used to magically indenture someone. The person to be indentured must read the activation word on the scroll. Once this is done the person who owns the scroll will be able to use their naphesh at will. 
## Spoken Spells
Advanced Mages can call forth spells “on the fly” without any scrolls. This can be incredibly dangerous as a misspoken word can be deadly. It also takes a much longer time, but has the advantage of being infinitely adaptable.
