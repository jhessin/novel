# Magic
Magic in the elseworld is created by “modifying the source code of reality”. This is done through the words of command. There are not many words of command, but by speaking or writing them in a specific order one can do nearly anything. 
## Words of Command
The most basic building blocks in magic are the words of command. These are derived from the Hebrew language, though not all are words of command. 
A single word of command is useless by itself, but when combined …
For example the word “fire” by itself or the word “create” by itself don’t mean anything, however if you combine them you can `MAKE FIRE`. 
## Energy Sources
This alone is not enough to create an effect. Like everything else magic needs a power source. The most common source is biological energy (nephesh), but there is an authority to magical sources. For example you can’t use someone else’s nephesh in ordinary circumstances, unless they use a spell to give you that authority. 
## Scrolls and Books
### and written words of power
Scrolls are a common form of magic. A Mage will write a spell out on a scroll using Runes of Command (the written form of Words of Command). The scroll may have an activation word which can be used by anyone to activate it. Once activated the scroll is destroyed like flash paper. 
Another use of a scroll is memorization. If a Mage memorizes a scroll he can call forth the power of that spell multiple times by reading the entire spell out loud to prepare it and then using the activation word.
Most spells have a lifetime in which they can be activated using their activation word. If a spell is not given a lifetime it can drain a wizard's life completely away.
Activation words can really be anything, but typically need to mean something to the caster.
Some scrolls are designed to be used only once and are always consumed. Others can only be used by reading them in their entirety, but can be used indefinitely.
Bequeather scrolls are used to magically indenture someone. The person to be indentured must read one activation word on the scroll and the master a second activation word. Once this is done the master will be able to use the servant's naphesh at will. 
Bequeather scrolls come in a variety of types, some only allow a master a minimal amount of control, while other's give a master carte-blanche. All of them have some type of time limitation however, otherwise they would kill either master or servant.
## Spoken Spells
Advanced Mages can call forth spells “on the fly” without any scrolls. This can be incredibly dangerous as a misspoken word can be deadly. It also takes a much longer time, but has the advantage of being infinitely adaptable.
