# The Kingdom of Enoch

The kingdom of Enoch was founded by Enoch the first, and each successive king
has taken the name Enoch in honor of him. In fact they don't use the name king,
but Enoch as a title. Enochs are not chosen by birth, but rather they are
either named by their predecessor or elected by the senate if no-one is named.
It is traditional to name the eldest son, but this is neither required nor
particularly encouraged. Another reason is that if the Enoch is dethroned he
loses his head (so if the Enoch's son is unfit he won't want to lose him).

The Enoch is checked by the senate - a representative body consisting of a
single elected person per township. They serve for life and are beheaded if
deposed. It is their responsibility to represent their town to the Enoch. A two
thirds majority vote is required to depose the Enoch (who is then beheaded),
but this is seldom done as no Enoch wants to lose their head so they strive to
serve the kingdom.

The Enoch doesn't have a palace, or many possessions, but is given the proper
amount of respect due his station. In fact the Enoch takes a vow of poverty.
All of their possessions belong to the station of Enoch and the senate must
vote to add or (rarely) remove anything to those. They serve the people - not
the other way around. Their possessions are enchanted so none can touch them
without pain unless given permission through a simple spell - which is
temporary.

The Enoch is head of the military and police (which is one body). Their primary
job is hiring, firing, and judging between the people and the army.

The army is not able to vote for the senate but are servants of the people as
well. Anyone who wants to join the army can do so only with the Enoch's
blessing, but the Enoch can only coerce someone into service with the agreement
of their senator and their senator has first say on their station.

Mayors are like kings of towns with all of their citizens being senators (Yes
they are also beheaded if they are impeached). Anyone with a grievance can
appeal to the Mayor, then the senator, then finally the Enoch. The chain can be
jumped only in life or death situations when they are afraid for their life.
