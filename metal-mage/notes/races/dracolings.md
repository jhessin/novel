# Dracolings

The children of dragons, these beings tend to vary greatly in their shape and
capabilities. Some breath fire, others can fly and have claws, yet others only
have incredible size and strength.

Regardless of what else they have all dracolings have some sort of scales and
descend directly from one of the great dragons.
