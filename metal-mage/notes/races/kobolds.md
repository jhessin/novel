# Kobolds

Kobolds are a type of cross breed created by the dragons as pets/servants.
Unlike most other nephilim kobolds can reproduce after their kind and are even
capable of being civilized to an extent. More intelligent than giants, they can
use basic tools and tend to enjoy digging. 

They appear as large rats, so much so that some have hypothesized that they are
related to wererats (one came from the other). There is insufficient evidence
to support this however.
