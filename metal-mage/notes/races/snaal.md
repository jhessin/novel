# Snaal

The Snaal are a race of arms traders. The are covered in a viscus slime that is said
to have a healing affect for their kind. They are walking chemical factories
that can copy any compound they come across using their mucus.

They are best known for their chemical weapons and stims. They are excellent
negotiators, but you should only trust them if you have a written contract.
