# Ghosts 
Ghosts are one form of spectre that is actually brought about from a human being trapped by some magic spell. Often they become attached to some artifact that outlasts their body.
Often confused for ghosts are Familiars, these demons follow a person until they die and then take on their appearance in order to instill fear in others.
