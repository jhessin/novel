# Leonin (work in progress)

The Leonin are a cat-like race with prehensile tails. They do not have the
vocal range to speak, but instead use hand gestures to communicate.

They are a standoffish race that prefer the company of their own kind to that
of outsiders. They tend to be taller and larger than most humans.

Their hands are as strong as a human, but their strongest limb is their tail
which is where they often attach multiple weapons. The length of their tails
vary from 4-6 feet and is malleable and strong enough to wield multiple weapons
at once.
