# Ali-Kai

The Ali-Kai are typically 'little green men'. They are actually a
symbiotic/parasitic species that create their own hosts. They can only control
their created hosts, but can bond with other species for communication and
regenerative purposes.

Their hosts (called Ali) are light but hearty ranging from 80-120 lbs and in
height from 4-8 ft. They are bioengineered for specific tasks - for example a
mechanic may be smaller to crawl under around a ship easier, but a warrior will
be larger.

Their symbiotic form (or Kai) has healing capabilities and can regenerate
almost anything. They cannot survive long without a host as they have no
circular-vascular system of their own yet they require oxygen like any brain.
