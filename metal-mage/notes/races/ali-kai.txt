# Ali-Kai
The Ali-Kai are typically 'little green men'. They are actually a symbiotic/parasitic species that create their own hosts. They can only control their created hosts, but can bond with other species for communication and regenerative purposes.
Their hosts (called Ali) are light but hearty ranging from 80-120 lbs and in height from 4-8 ft.
Their symbiotic form ( or Kai )has healing capabilities and can regenerate almost anything. They cannot survive long without a host as they have no circulatory system of their own.
