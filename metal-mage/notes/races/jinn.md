# Jinn

The Jinn or genies are created magical beings. The are created with the union
of a willing human and demon.

They are by nature tricksters. They tend to bend all but the most inane wishes
(a comfortable pair of underwear anyone?) to cause destruction and havoc.

They are bound to an artifact (iconically an oil lamp, but it can be anything
that opens) and are summoned into existence when it is opened.

They have no magical ability other than that of granting wishes. They must
grant the wish of anyone who holds their artifact, and must abide by whatever
is spoken.

They appear as human with swirling tattoos. Their tattoos will shift
periodically and rapidly when granting a wish.

There is no wish limit, however their trickster nature makes making wishes
incredibly risky.
