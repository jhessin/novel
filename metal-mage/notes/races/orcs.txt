# Orcs
Orcs are a bloodthirsty race of beast like men. Each tribe has slightly different characteristics depending on their totem animal. 
The boar tribe for example has tusks that stick out of their mouths and tough leathery skin. Whereas the lion tribeâ€™s razor sharp teeth remain in their mouths and they have a thick mane of fur. 
All orcs have greenish or grey skin (perhaps from their dragon heritage) and a brutal nature.
