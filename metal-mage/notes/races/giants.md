# Giants

Giants are a type of nephilim that appear as large humans. Their mothers are
nearly always killed during delivery as a viable giant baby will tear through
them as they are born.

Giants are the oldest form of nephilim and the most common. Their intelligence
is severely limited as they are apt to smash through any problem. They range
between 9-15 feet and tend to weigh up to 900 lbs.
