# Grillbrick

Grillbrick is a dwarf (see [Dwarves][]). He is strong and courageous and
constantly bickering with [Sassel Samufras][] He will do anything to protect
his friends.

He is quite dexterous for a dwarf and prefers two hand axes which he will often
throw at his enemies.

He began life as a trapper, often bringing game to his father who was the
tribeâ€™s cook. He learned many recipes from his father and has proven quite the
culinarian himself.
