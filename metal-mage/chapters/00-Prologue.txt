  Lok Tor peered out on an alien landscape. Strange lights without the familiar
flicker of fire burned all across the landscape. With a minor exercise of his
will the bottom of his flying craft became opaque. It had worked. The rift
drive had worked - just as the prophet had said it would. On this side of the
veil lay salvation for all of Eden.
  Now was not the time for celebration however. This victory had come at a
great cost. The wounds from the battle would not heal easily (if at all) and he
still needed to find the Source - the one who had drawn him here.
