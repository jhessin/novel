# Prologue

Lok Tor peered out on an alien landscape. Strange lights without the familiar
flicker of fire burned all across the landscape. With a minor exercise of his
will the bottom of his flying craft became opaque. It had worked. The rift
drive had worked --- just as the prophet had said it would. On this side of the
veil lay salvation for all of Eden.

Now was not the time for celebration however. This victory had come at a great
cost. The wounds from the battle would not heal easily (if at all) and he still
needed to find the Source --- the one who had drawn him here. He had felt the
pull as soon as he had accepted the prophet's words as true. At first it had no
direction it was just a yearning for some nebulous future. As time went on and
the prophet had revealed this other world to him he had known this was where he
needed to go.

The fire of magic was fading from Eden, and with it many races that depended on
it would die, but he knew the Source would be able to fix it, even though he
didn't know how such a thing was possible. If the prophet was right (and he
had yet to be mistaken) this land had no magic.

*No matter, I must have faith*, he thought as his body ached. *I
must find a safe place to land.*

The craft settled into a large field a bit more loudly than Tor would have
liked. He began running system diagnostics as well as setting his
*ferrovitae* to heal his many wounds. Once he was feeling better he
would explore this new world. He just had to ...

< *knock, knock* >

A light wrapping on the outer hull of his craft drew the Femian's attention.
There was no way someone could have found his ship so quickly. He had been
camouflaged..., but no, the stealth drive had failed, but even still it was
the dead of night, everyone should be sleeping.

He focused to open a small view-port in a *ferrovitae* portion of the
ship. He could see a small human child cautiously walking around the ship and
tapping on the outer hull. This was not good. Nothing was frightened so easily
as a human child, and if the people of this realm thought him malevolent, he
would not be able to search as he desired.

As the child turned to go (possibly getting an adult), Lok Tor decided, on a
whim, to extend an invitation to this child. It would be more likely to get a
friendly response to a one-on-one visit than from the mob that would inevitably
accost him later.

So it was that, just as the boy was turning away, motion caught his eye and he
saw on opening in the previously smooth metal surface. Just before the boy
entered Lok Tor attempted to cast a minor illusion to appear as a human
himself, however to his shock it didn't work. He couldn't even hide his wounds
which the boy would surely find frightening.

Surely enough as soon as the boy was close enough to see the form of the Femian
he gasped in shock. Tor cringed at the expected sight of the boy cowering in fear, but
it didn't seem to last long as fear gave way to concern as the human child noticed
his wounds.
