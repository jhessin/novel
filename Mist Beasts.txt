# Mist Beasts 
Mist beasts take on the form of a persons worst fears. It is said they can only be killed by the person who gives them their form - however this cannot be corroborated as they invariably kill their victim and then dissipate back into mist. 
It is uncertain where Mist Beasts (or the Mists for that matter) come from.
