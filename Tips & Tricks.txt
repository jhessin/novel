# Tips & Tricks
We‚Äôve built all sorts of useful features into Bear to help you turn ideas into notes as fast as possible. Read on to step up your Bear game.

But if you want to start from the beginning, head over to [[Welcome to Bear]], learn how to [[Organize and Publish]] your notes, and check out [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]].

## Advanced Search
Bear can instantly search all your notes, but it also has a number of [advanced search operators](https://bear.app/faq/Advanced%20search%20options%20in%20Bear/) that can focus on certain types of content in your notes.

For example, you can type `@todo` in the search box to find all notes with tasks, or `@files` to find all notes with attachments. You can also use `@images` to find _just_ those kinds of attachments. Finally, you can use double quotes to search specific phrases, such as `"bear is cool"`. 

## Browser and App Extensions
It‚Äôs easy to collect text, images, attachments, and entire web pages from other apps. Learn how to add and use Bear‚Äôs extensions for [iPad, iPhone](https://bear.app/faq/Extensions/iOS%20App%20Extension/), and [Mac](https://bear.app/faq//Extensions/Browser%20extensions/).

## Tap Those Tags
All tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, make sure you aren‚Äôt editing a note by pressing Command + Return with a keyboard, or swiping to hide the keyboard on iOS.

Then, in any note, tap a tag like #welcome/pro tag‚Äîthe Notes List will appear and show you all notes which contain that tag.

On Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically üòâ). Use the Layout Selector (the bottom right icon) to see your options.

## Link notes together ‚õì
One of Bear‚Äôs really fun and useful features is Note Linking. It‚Äôs great for quickly moving between multiple notes in a project, creating a choose-your-own adventure, or using multiple notes to welcome users to a fuzzy, red new app! üòâ

To link one note in another:

* Type two brackets like this: *[[* anywhere in a note 
* Type a couple letters of the note you want to link
* A Suggestion Box will appear with notes to suggestion
* Select one of the suggested notes, and Bear will insert the note‚Äôs name, a link, and two final brackets in your current note

*Tip*: If you‚Äôre using a keyboard with a Mac or iPad, you can use the arrow keys and Return to select a suggested note.
