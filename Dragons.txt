# Dragons
Dragons are demons in their physical form most of the time. They can technically shapeshift into any form they like but they love the power of dragon form the best.
Dragons are immortal - being demons there is no way to destroy them, but only banish them from the physical plane for a time. 
The children of dragons are not dragons but are called the [[Nephelim]]. Most prominent are the [[Dracolings]] - which are identified by their scales.
